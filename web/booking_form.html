            <h3>Acknowledgment:</h3>
            <p>Daybreak Adventures Pty Ltd wishes to acknowledge All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
              people as the Traditional Custodians of the lands and waters on which we live, operate, and
              travel through. We pay our respects to their Elders past present and emerging and recognise
              their continuous connection and contribution to country, community and culture.</p>

            <h3>Our Contract:</h3>
            <p>All bookings are made with Daybreak Adventures Pty Ltd (ABN 66 671 883 819). Any reference to
              ‘Daybreak’, ‘we’, ‘our’ and ‘us’ equates to Daybreak Adventures Pty Ltd. By booking a tour with
              us you have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions set out in these booking conditions.
              Your booking will be accepted by us on this basis. The services to be provided are those
              referred to in your booking confirmation and/or invoice.</p>

            <h3>Liability Disclaimer:</h3>
            <p>While we take every possible step to ensure your safety and satisfaction, Daybreak cannot be held
              responsible for illness, injury, damages, loss, delay, or any inability to join a tour due to
              factors beyond our control, including Force Majeure events. We strongly advise all passengers to
              secure comprehensive travel insurance. Daybreak also reserves the right to modify routes,
              itineraries, fares, inclusions, operating days, or even cancel tours in the event of unforeseen
              circumstances.</p>

            <h3>Vaccination Requirements:</h3>
            <p>Vaccination criteria for customers may differ from one state to another. Please be aware that
              these government regulations can change, so if you are not vaccinated, we kindly advise you to
              contact us before your travel.</p>

            <h3>Cancellation & Change of Date Policy:</h3>
            <p>Applicable to emails received by phone or email during our regular office hours. Requests
              received between the hours of 5 pm and 7 am will apply to the next business day. Any change of
              date is subject to availability and will be accepted in line with the same notice period
              required for cancellations. Full refund available with cancellation 24 hours before the
              road-trip start time. No refund for cancellations made within 24 hours of the road-trip start
              time. Changes requested within 24 hours of the road-trip start time will not be accommodated.
              Departure and destination times align with Melbourne local time. In the event of a road trip
              cancellation due to severe weather conditions, you will be given the option of either a full
              refund or an alternative travel date.</p>

            <h3>Special cancellation terms apply to the tours listed below:</h3>
            <p>“Ocean Vibes - Geelong, Ferries, Wineries & Sorrento”: Due to the nature of the Geelong tours
              which include also bookings that are made with Third Party Operators: Searoad Ferries, the
              following terms will apply to any cancellations for the Ocean Vibes tours: Full refund available
              with cancellation 48 hours before the road-trip start time.</p>

            <h3>Child Policy:</h3>
            <p>We welcome children on our tours; all travellers under the age of 18 years old must be
              accompanied by an adult or guardian. The suitability may vary depending on the tour's nature and
              duration, therefore, we recommend consulting our reservations team for personalized
              recommendations before making a booking. Given that our tours are charged per booking, a child
              rate is not applicable. Children from birth to 7 years must not travel on adult laps and are
              required to be safely secured in a child restraint. Please make sure to either bring your own or
              request an appropriate seating arrangement for their safety and comfort at least 24 hours before
              the road-trip start time. It is possible to carry child restraint, pushers and prams within the
              luggage space of our vehicles. We strongly advise checking with our reservations staff prior to
              bringing these items on the tour. Passengers arriving with these items on tours where they are
              not permitted may be denied boarding without eligibility for a refund. We encourage you to
              discuss your plans with our reservations team before finalizing your booking.</p>

            <h3>Luggage Policy:</h3>
            <p>For your comfort during the tours, we do not provide luggage facilities; soft travelling is
              highly recommended with an allowance of a small day pack no bigger than 5-7kg per traveller. To
              ensure a smooth, safe and inclusive experience for every traveller during the tours, please
              inform us in advance of any requirements for storing any walking aids such as foldable
              wheelchairs, pushers, prams and walking frames. Dimensions of these aids must be prior confirmed
              with our support team before the tour. Please note that any excess of luggage may result in a
              surcharge fee. On the day of departure, inappropriate items such as surfboards, bikes, or an
              excessive amount of luggage may lead to refusal to board, unless prior arrangements have been
              made.</p>

            <h3>Pick-up & Drop-off:</h3>
            <p>A complimentary service of pick-up and drop-off is included in all bookings for any location
              within a 10km radius from Melbourne CBD, we refer to this as our “Short pickups”; the precise
              location from which the radius is measured starts from the intersection of Bourke St and
              Elizabeth St – VIC, 3000 or as we refer, the “CBD centre point”. Pick-up & Drop-off service is
              also offered to a further 10 km radius from the Short pickups ending zone, these are referred to
              as our “Long pick-ups” and are offered at a $50.00 surcharge per tour booking. Our service does
              not run beyond this maximum distance from the CBD centre point. Please be aware that travellers
              are responsible for being present at the front of the chosen pickup location at least 10 minutes
              before departure. Failure to wait at the location nominated during your booking may lead to the
              driver being unable to locate you, resulting in failure to board. Daybreak cannot be held
              responsible for passengers who do not board on time for departure. The traveller is responsible
              for verifying that the tour details on their confirmation are accurate, and their provided
              contact details are up to date. Daybreak may need to contact passengers regarding the tour
              before the departure date. We recommend providing an Australian mobile number and regularly
              checking your email leading up to your tour.</p>

            <h3>Meals:</h3>
            <p>All our tours feature a complimentary lunch break; during the tour, travellers are offered to
              choose from a curated selection of meal options available at our partnering restaurants and
              cafés. Please note that the availability of specific menu items may vary, and travellers are
              encouraged to inquire about the meal options in advance if they have specific dietary
              preferences or restrictions.</p>

            <h3>Special Requirements:</h3>
            <p>Notify us of any food allergies, dietary needs, or medical conditions at the time of booking or
              at least 24 hours before the tour departure. While we make efforts to cater to diverse dietary
              requirements, some regions may have limited food options. Although not guaranteed, your
              proactive communication allows us to forward plan and endeavour to accommodate any specific
              requirements. For travellers with specific dietary needs, we suggest bringing snacks along for
              your convenience during the tour.</p>

            <h3>Pricing and Surcharges:</h3>
            <p>Prices are shown in Australian Currency and are correct at the time of booking. Our tour prices
              are subject to variable and seasonal pricing, common in the travel industry.

            <h3>Communication:</h3>
            <p>At Daybreak, we value your privacy and may use the details you provide, such as your name, phone
              number, and email address, to communicate essential booking information, updates about our
              products, and promotional offers. We respect your choices, and all our marketing communications
              will include an option for you to easily opt out if you prefer not to receive further updates.
